                        League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in the three-dimensional isometric perspective.
                        Players compete in matches, lasting about 20 to 50 minutes on average. In the main game mode(ranked mode) two teams consisting of five players each compete against each other.
                        The main goal is to destroy the enemy's core building called Nexus in the enemy team's base. Each player from each team has to choose from 5 roles in the game. The roles are: Top Laner, Mid Laner, ADC, Supporter and Jungler.
                        The game is divided in to 3 phrases : early game, mid game and late game. In the early game (also called laning phase) the players try.to kill so called minions, which give the player gold to buy items.
                        The items give the player different buffs for example attack speed, ability power, magic resist, health or armor. The Mid and Late game for team fighting and taking down objectives like dragons and the Baron (which give the
                        players
                        additional buffs). With each level you get, your death timer increases so you have to
                        wait longer each time you die until you respawn.
                        There are currently 147 champions to play. Each champion has unique abilities and attacks thus you can "counter" pick the enemy team. After killing minions and/or killing enemy players you gain experience points until you
                        level
                        up.
                        With each new level you can upgrade one of your abilities. The maximum level you van reach is level 18.
                        In ranked mode you get elo poitns by winning matches. There are 6 rank-tiers with 4 divisions each. Starting from Bronze IV all the way up to Challenger.
                        After winning 100 elo points you get to play 3 Promotion matches. If you win atleast 2 of them you reach the next divison.
                        If you are in the highest divison of the tier and reach 100 points you gett to play 5 promotions games. If you win atleast 3 of them you rank up to the next tier. </b>

                        The map the players play on, is called Summoner's Rift which is divided in to three lanes (Top lane, Mid Lane and Bot Lane.) There is also the Jungle. On each lane every team has 3 turrets and one Inhibitor
                        on their side, which have to be destroyed first before getting to the Nexus which is also protected by 2 other turrets. The Top and Mid Laners are obviously on the top and mid Lane, the jungler in the jungle and the ADC,

                        League E-sports is divided into different Regions and each region has his own League. For example LEC is the european League, LCS is the north american league and LCk is the korean league.
                        Each league works a bit differenet. For example in the LEC 10 teams compete in a season which is divided into 2 splits. The regular season of each split consists of 9 weeks of play, in which each team plays each other twice,
                        for a total of 18 games each.At the end of each split, a playoff consisting of the top 6 teams from the regular season is played to determine the final standings. Each split's playoffs award cash prizes and Championship
                        Points.
                        CHampionship Points are used to determine qualification into the annual League of Legends World Championship.
                        The winner of the summer split automatically qualifies as Europe's first seed, while the next four teams ranked by Championship Point total play the Regional Qualifier Tournament to determine the two additional seeds for the
                        World
                        Championship.
